    "1. APIs allow for modular development, where different components of a system can be developed and updated independently. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. When using APIs, applications can become dependent on external systems or services. \n",

    "2. API users rely on the API provider to maintain and update the API. This can result in limited control over the functionality, performance, and security of the API.\n",
